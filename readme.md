Basic Electronics
=================
**Charges**

Everything around us is made of atoms which consists of positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron. The number of positive and negative charges is usually equal which makes it neutral. 

When a substance acquires excess electron, it becomes negatively charged. ANd when it loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged.

**Voltage**

Two substances that have opposite charges or unequal amount of charges will exert electromotive force between them. This force is measure by the potential difference or voltage. This force usually causes electrons to flow through a substance. 

**Current**

The flow of electron is called current and is measured in Amperes. For any given substance the amount of current that will be generated depends on the resistance of the substance. The resistance of a substance is a measure of how much effort is requred to make electrons move through the substance. It is measured in ohms. Metallic substances usually have very low resistance and are referred to as conductors. Whereas non-metallic substances have high resistance and are referred to as insulators.

Types of Components
---------------------
Substances that we use to make our circuit are called components.

**Wire**

A wire is a conductor that can be used to connect two components to each other so that current can flow from one to another.

**Battery**

A batery is a chemical substance with special conductors provided at both ends and it generates a potential difference between the two conductors, also known as terminals. The positive terminal is called the anode and the negative terminal is called the cathode.

**Resistor**

A resistor is a conductor that has a given amount of resistance to the flow of current. If a resistor is connected between the terminals of a battery, a current will flow from the positive to the negative. The amount of current is inversely proportional to the resistance of the resistor: the higher the resistance the lower the current.


**Lamp**

The energy that electrons carry is absorbed by the resistance of a material when they move through it and converted to heat. This heat can turn the material white hot in the case of tungsten filament used in incandescent lamps.

There are other kinds of lights that does not involve heat. They are called light emitting diodes (LED).

**Switches**

Is a mechanical device that can be make or break the connection between a component and a battery.


Circuits
---------

Many components can be connected together to make a circuit. A circuit is designed to perform a certain function e.g. a keypad circuit enables you to enter characters into a phone or computer, an led array can be used to display information.
